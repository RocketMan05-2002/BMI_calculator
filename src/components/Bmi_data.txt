The BMI Calculator App is a simple web application built using React 
that helps users calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their 
weight and height. It dynamically updates the BMI as the user adjusts 
their weight and height using sliders.


How the App Works

1. User Inputs (Weight & Height)
	â€¢	The app has two interactive range sliders where users can adjust their weight (kg) and height (cm).
	â€¢	The weight range is from 20 kg to 200 kg.
	â€¢	The height range is from 50 cm to 250 cm.
	â€¢	When the user moves the slider, the corresponding weight or height value updates in real time.

2. BMI Calculation
	â€¢	The app calculates BMI using the standard formula:

BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}

	â€¢	Since height is given in centimeters, it is converted into meters before applying the formula.
	â€¢	The BMI value is rounded to one decimal place for better readability.

3. Real-time Updates with useMemo
	â€¢	The useMemo hook is used to optimize performance by recalculating the BMI only when weight or height changes.
	â€¢	This ensures the app does not perform unnecessary calculations on every re-render.

4. Displaying Results
	â€¢	The calculated BMI value is displayed in the output section.
	â€¢	Based on the BMI result, the app provides feedback to the user:
	â€¢	BMI < 20 â†’ "Gain some muscles broski!" (Indicates being underweight)
	â€¢	BMI between 20 - 25 â†’ "You are in shape" (Indicates a healthy weight range)
	â€¢	BMI > 25 â†’ "You are overweight! :))" (Indicates being overweight)
